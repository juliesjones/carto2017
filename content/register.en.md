### Conference & Travel Assistance
To assist in achieving and maintaining a diverse and inclusive conference makeup, the ACMLA Treasurer has allocated a portion of Association funds towards conference funding assistance for ACMLA/ACACC members attending the 2017 ACMLA Conference and Annual General Meeting in Vancouver and Burnaby, British Columbia. Conference Funding Assistance will be granted according to the [ACMLA Policy on Travel Funding](https://acmla-acacc.ca/docs/ACMLA_conference-travel_funding_policy.pdf).

We ask all applicants to first try and find funding at their own institutions. Please note that applicants who are contributing to the Annual Conference/AGM program will be considered first. All applicants to this fund must be members of ACMLA in good standing. 

To apply for travel assistance, please complete and submit the [Conference Assistance Application Form](https://goo.gl/forms/ooP0wqD8HDvmW9iI2) by May 15, 2017. Questions regarding the application process should be sent to Siobhan Hanratty, ACMLA Past-President, at past.president@acmla-acacc.ca
