### Building "deep" maps of the Great War: Critical information and modern approaches for developing integrated, interactive map exhibits using historical resources
### Presenters
Rebecca Bartlett, Carleton University
Gordon Beck, McMaster University | Jason Brodeur, McMaster University | Trevor Ford, Wilfrid Laurier University
### Abstract
Corresponding with Canada’s 150th anniversary, the ongoing centenary of the First World War provides Canadians with an occasion to rediscover stories from a conflict that helped shape the identity of a nation. Among the many modes for communicating these experiences and events, interactive digital maps--or “deep maps”--provide a unique and powerful means of presenting information and engaging audiences. By interacting with diverse types of digitized historical materials arranged in both time and space, the user is afforded a media-rich, multidimensional experience of a story. 

To this end, the goal of this workshop is to enhance participants’ understanding of cartography and history of the Great War, and to develop their skills for using digital historical materials to create interactive and integrative map exhibits. Through a series of integrated information sessions and hands-on activities, participants will reinforce their learning by discovering and developing materials, and building their own interactive map exhibit using one (or multiple) platforms. In the process, the workshop content will address a number of common issues related to historical GIS development. 

Instructional elements of this workshop will include:
Cartography and the great war: historical context; understanding and using grid reference systems; finding cartographic resources.
Finding and understanding materials from the Great War
Tackling common issues in HGIS
Creating geospatial information from historical materials
Developing ‘deep maps’: An introduction to a variety of platforms for creating interactive map exhibits.
