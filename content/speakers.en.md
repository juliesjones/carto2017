## Trevor Ford
Trevor Ford is a third year PhD Candidate at Wilfrid Laurier University. Having started his PhD at Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2013 under the supervision of Dr. Mark Humphries, Trevor was offered the chance to come to WLU with Mark in order to continue his studies and join the Laurier Centre for Military Strategic Disarmament Studies in 2014 as Archival Manager. Since his arrival, Trevor has led the archiving staff to completely reorganize and cataloging LCMSDS’ holdings, including a year-long scanning project that digitized all of the Centre’s maps. Currently he has just finished setting up LCMSDS’ new website waterlooatwar.ca, which chronicles the Waterloo County based 118th Battalion during the First World War. Trevor is currently working on several different projects including one that is a joint venture with the University of Waterloo’s Geospatial Centre in which the Centre’s maps are being geo-referenced and added to Google Maps.
With help from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Joseph-Bombardier Research Scholarship and under the supervision of Dr. Humphries, Trevor’s doctoral research covers the role of the Canadian military’s intelligence units and their domestic activities during the First World War. Trevor specifically examines the Military Intelligence Branch and their conduct against real and perceived enemies during and immediately after the war. This subject is not only unexplored but is also highly relevant to today’s national security apparatus and the wider concept of state security in Canada. Trevor has published three articles on this subject and is currently working on a collected letters book.
